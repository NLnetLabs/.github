## üíö Hello from NLnet Labs!

Founded in 1999, NLnet Labs is an independent, non-profit foundation
based in the Netherlands. Our mission is to make the core of the Internet a
better, safer place by developing open-source software, through applied
research and by promoting and contributing to open standards.

### üå± Sustainable Open-Source

We believe in sustainable open-source software. NLnet Labs is not owned by a
commercial organisation. We operate independently with 16 full-time
developers and researchers on staff. We are funded by organisations who rely
on our software and by those who think our work is important.

### ü§ù Our Commitment to You

- Our software is, and always will be, open-source with a liberal license
- We will have at least two developers on each of our projects
- You will always get all features for free, we will never adopt a "freemium"
  model
- We will only develop functionality that serves the general benefit of the
  Internet community
- Because our software is used in mission critical environments, we offer
  support services with a service-level agreement
- We guarantee continued maintenance of our software for at least two years
  in the unlikely event all funding would disappear

### ü´∂ Support our Work

We cannot do any of our work without your support. If you depend on our
software, please consider purchasing [professional support
and consultancy services with a service-level
agreement](https://www.nlnetlabs.nl/services/contracts/) for one of our
products, [sponsoring](https://www.nlnetlabs.nl/sponsors/) the development of
new software or a feature for an existing product, or through a 
[donation](https://www.nlnetlabs.nl/funding/).

### üåà A Vibrant Community
