# Pluotos: Cross-compiling

The `cross` cross-compiling job runs before the other jobs in the Pluotos workflow.

Cross compilation takes place inside a Docker container running an image from the Rust [`cross`](https://github.com/cross-rs/cross) project. These images contain the correct toolchain components needed to compile for one of the [supported targets](https://github.com/cross-rs/cross#supported-targets).

_**Note:** We deliberately do not use other mechanisms to do cross-compilation. Alternatives were explored but found lacking. Docker buildx QEmu based cross-compilation for example is far too slow ([due to the emulated execution](https://github.com/multiarch/qemu-user-static/issues/176#issuecomment-1191078533)) and doesn't parallelize across multiple GitHub hosted runners. Native Rust Cargo support for cross-compilation requires you to know more about the required toolchain, to install the required tools yourself including the appropriate strip tool, to add a `.cargo/config.toml` file to your project with the paths to the tools to use (which may vary by build environment!), and as a Rust project the fact that the `cross` tool was originally developed by the Rust Embedded Working Group Tools team makes it highly attractive for our use case._

_**Known issue:** [Cross-compilation is not customisable](https://github.com/NLnetLabs/.github/issues/42)_

## Inputs

The `cross` job uses a single Pluotos workflow input, _either_:

- `cross_build_rules` - A **JSON** array of [Rust target triples](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustc/platform-support.html) to cross-compile your application for, _or_
- `cross_build_rules_path` - A path to a **YAML** file equivalent of the `cross_build_rules` array.

YAML file example:

`pkg/rules/cross_build_rules.yml`:
```yaml
- 'arm-unknown-linux-musleabihf'
- 'arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf'
```

## Outputs

The result of cross-compilation is a temporary artifact uploaded to GitHub Actions that will be downloaded by later jobs in the Pluotos workflow. This is because, as the GitHub Actions ["Storing workflow data as artifacts" docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/storing-workflow-data-as-artifacts) say, _"Artifacts allow you to share data between jobs in a workflow_".

In the example above this would cause temporary artifacts with the following names to be uploaded:

- `tmp-cross-binaries-arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf`
- `tmp-cross-binaries-arm-unknown-linux-musleabihf`

While these are referred to as "temporary" artifacts (because they are not needed after the later jobs consume them) they are actually not deleted by the Pluotos workflow in case they are useful for debugging issues with the packaging process. GitHub Actions will anyway [delete workflow artifacts after 90 days by default](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/storing-workflow-data-as-artifacts#about-workflow-artifacts).
